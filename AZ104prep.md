# AZ-104
## Labs and Learn content
- [Learn collection for AZ-104 including both labs and lessons](https://aka.ms/AZ-104LearningPaths) - this new Learn collection contains all the lessons from AZ-104 plus all the lab exercises in one convenient place. This can replace your Skillpipe guide. However, please do file any issues you encounter with the collection or its contents, as this is a new migration effort. Thank for your contributions, and we hope you find this new method helpful and easier to access!
- [AZ-104 Labs](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/) - this Github link will be updated continuously as the labs are improved over time. You'll need your own Azure subscription after your Azure Pass expires.

## Module documentation
- For links to relevant documentation, please view the [Study guides](https://aka.ms/ESIStudyGuides) link on my  [General Resources](https://github.com/ginnielizz/ESILearnerResources/blob/main/GeneralResources.md) page and seek the AZ-104 study guide. (The direct link target changes regularly.)
-  There is a Learn path for [Azure admin prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-administrator-prerequisites/) that might be helpful if you've got some gaps to fill in other fundamental cloud topics.
-  - [Learn collection for AZ-104 including both labs and lessons](https://aka.ms/AZ-104LearningPaths) - As mentioned above, this new Learn collection contains all the lessons from AZ-104 plus all the lab exercises in one convenient place. It's still, however, a good idea to deep dive into the documentation for certain topics using the links above.

### Networking
- For filling in networking gaps, consider the [Fundamentals of computer networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/network-fundamentals/) path on Microsoft Learn.
- I like this external [Subnet mask cheat sheet](https://cnes.com/subnets.html) link because I hate trying to make my brain process CIDR notation.
- That said, you should understand the basics of CIDR notation. :) Check out [this post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/configuring-azure-virtual-network-subnets-with-cidr-notation/ba-p/2047809) for help.

## External learning
- For folks who want to learn more about Kubernetes and how it works, this [video by Carson](https://vimeo.com/245778144/4d1d597c5e) is old but a pretty solid explanation that holds up well. He starts from basics and gets deeper and deeper as it goes on.
